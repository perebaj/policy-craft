# Front End

# Tiny improvements

- Improve the color management
    - The tailwind CSS color management is enough for the project, creating different color variables increases a lot the complexity of the project.
- Eslint and Prettier
    - The project has a lot of code style issues, it would be nice to have a linter and a formatter to fix them.
- Add a CI/CD pipeline focused on the frontend(triggered when changes are made in the `frontend` folder)
- Add a Makefile to improve the command line & interface between the developer and the project
